Naming conventions for spatial_feature_extractor.c:

* sfe_GEOM_DESC_features for all the low level feature groups.  DESC
   can be blank if there aren't multiple subgroups.  Example:
   sfe_path_polygon_features, sfe_polygon_features, sfe_prism_features,
   sfe_polygon_avs_features

* For feature groups associated with edges in the model we have:
   sfe_ESDCTYPE_GEOM_ESDCTYPE_GEOM.  Examples: sfe_f_path_l_polygon
   sfe_f_polygon_l_polygon, sfe_f_prism_l_prism
