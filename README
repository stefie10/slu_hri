This is the spatial language understanding package written by the
Robust Robotics Research Group.

* You must install java and set the JAVA_HOME environment variable.
* Run "rake setup" to compile 3rd party dependencies. 
* To test the forklift mobile-manipulation code, run "rake
  train_forklift" in du_crf3 to build the model.  Then run "rake
  tests" in forklift.  If all these test cases pass, it is
  successfully following commands such as "put the tire pallet on the
  truck."
