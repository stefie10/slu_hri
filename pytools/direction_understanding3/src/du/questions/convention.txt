About actions:
--------------
An action should be described by a dictionary.

suppose A is an action:

A["action"] will be in {"insert","delete","modify"}

A["position"] would be an integer between 0 and len(sdcs).

A["sdc"] would be an sdc structure. For "action":"delete" it would not be important.
