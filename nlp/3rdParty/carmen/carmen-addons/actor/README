It's very simple -- it reads a script from standard input of the form:
x1 y1
x2 y2
pause seconds
...

where each line is either and x and y coordinate separated by spaces
(in meteres) or "pause" followed by a floating point number specifying
how many seconds.

you can interact with it from the command line or just redirect it's
input from a file.  if you are interacting with it on the command line
to quit you need to type C-d (which is EOF).

for files it just dies when the file ends.  You can also just do:
echo "3.2 5.1\n2.5 4.2\npause 20\n3.2 5.1" | actor
in a shell script for example.
