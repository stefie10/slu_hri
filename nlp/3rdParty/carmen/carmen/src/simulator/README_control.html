Control flow for the simulator

Basicly just all the functions in simulator.c

map_get_gridmap_message in main. The map will probably be recieved
when IPC_publishData is called withing publish_frontlaser_message or

window. button_press_event was connected to the button press signal
by the call to gtk_signal_connect in displayMap. click_handler
was established as the handler for such a button press by the call
to subscribe_clicks in main. */
