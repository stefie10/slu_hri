documentation to proccontrol needs to be extended

documentation for global/geometry would be nice

get a data file for model learn and send to ron parr

check b21r in carmen-addons and move to carmen main

graphical proccontrol_view 

carmen-addons 
=============

merge cerebellum modules into single module

ask jared re: r03, roadmap, robotwalker, roomnav, sound_server, stracker, actor, dog, dot

Should we do this?
===================

maybe delete mapeditor?


Wish list 
=========

QT guis

IPC message size test

command shell

merge read-rec, readlog, log reading  (see e.g. logtools/clf-read-example.c)

all modules should use ipc-wrapper-functions, no IPC directly...

generic logging in java
port map_editor/hmap_editor to gtk 2.0
port map_tracker to gtk 2.0
  
laser module/messages
   Add error messages when laser fails to connect.

Test programs for
   Localize, navigator

- robotgraph -- when turning to face a point, and the network goes out, robot
keeps turning for 1-3 secs. Why?

all base modules -- none of them set the acceleration field of the odometry
message correctly. This needs to be fixed.

add reading functions to logger_io.

sonar/ir/bumper: should be a method to request current configurations. 

logger  ---  add param change recording to logger, and param change playback
	        to playback
             make logger log arbitrary messages
             version stamping
             logger usage statement


map_editor -- 	no support for deleting offlimits.
	        no support for undo while creating offlimits.
                offlimits not handled properly by minimize/rotate -- 
                possibly other programs?
                better usage statements

map_read -- fix buffer size problem with username/origin/description
            fields in cmrt_map_read_creator_chunk, and null problem
	          with creation_time field
