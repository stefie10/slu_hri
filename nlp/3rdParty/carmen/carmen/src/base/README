finale@mit.edu, 3/11/2006, useful information

=== in the base directory ===

* arm_interfaces and base_interface define the general interfaces for
other programs to subscribe and query messages.  base_interface
actually should be drive_interface, but the name has been kept the
same for outside consistency.

* main program(s):

drive_main -- handles driving related messages
arm_main -- handles arm messages

these two programs define the message handling for driving and arm
respectively; drive and arm main call functions from drive_low_level
and arm_low_level.

* low level calls: drive_low_level.h and arm_low_level.h are the h
files that define the functions that the message handlers in
drive_main and arm_main may call

=== in the orcbotlib directory === 

orc_arm_lib.c and orc_drive_lib.c implement the functions in
drive_low_level and arm_low_level for the orc in particular.  they
call functions from orclib.  they store pointers to the orc created by
drive and arm main.

* orc library: (located in the orclib sub directory )

orclib provides the basic io interface to the orc board, with low
level commands such as set_motor, etc. for now, this should remain
separate of carmen dependencies so that we can take advantage and
contribute to the developing orc c libraries from orcboard.org

=== orc4 support ===

all orc4 related files are in orcbotlibv4, including the old
base_low_level, arm_low_level, and base_main which implement functions
needed for RSS course... since this contains course specific stuff,
we've refrained from changing any of the structure (note: this
directory should be decommissioned/removed in spring 2007 because at
that point the course will be using orc5)
