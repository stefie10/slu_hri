The code in this directory is a modification of the DRobot daemon for
the XR4000 Robot released by David Austin under the GNU Public License
(GPL). His code in turn, was based on code now released by Nomadic
Technologies under the GPL as well. 

I took the liberty of removing everything from the code that shouldn't
have been there in the first place (in my humble opinion). I have
removed the following:
* arm / lift support
* laser support (500 and 550)
* compass support
* the socket interface
* buggy useless libraries.

I have replaced the socket interface with an IPC interface
(http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/TCA/www/ipc/ipc.html)
conforming to the CARMEN robot toolkit interface.

I have also cleaned up much of the remaining code, including fixing a
few bugs. This code comes with no warranties. See LICENSE.TXT for the
full text of the GNU Public license.

Technologies.
