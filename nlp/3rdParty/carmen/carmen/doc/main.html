<h1>Welcome to CARMEN</h1><br>

This is a quite early version of the documentation of CARMEN. It is
not complete but should be helpful when programming with CARMEN.


@section mainpage_modules The Structure of CARMEN

CARMEN is an open-source collection of software for mobile robot
control. CARMEN is modular software designed to provide basic
navigation primatives including: base and sensor control, logging,
obstacle avoidance, localization, path planning, and mapping.  The
modules are shown in the left navigator bar. Click of the different
modules to browser their messages, libraries, functions, data
structures, etc.

The communication between CARMEN modules is handled using a separate
package called IPC, Copyright 1991 Christopher Fedor and Reid
Simmons. IPC is distributed along with CARMEN.
