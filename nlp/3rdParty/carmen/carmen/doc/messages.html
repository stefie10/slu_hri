<h2>CARMEN Messages</h2>


@section messages_introduction Introduction

In all messages, the distance units are in metres. Angle measurements in
radians, in the range \f$-\pi\f$ to \f$\pi\f$. Velocity units are m/sec. The timestamp
is given as the number of seconds since the unix epoch, and is a double, where
the fractional part is computed from the \c tv_usec field of the
\c timeval struct returned by \c gettimeofday. More information on
units and co-ordinate frames can be found in the CARMEN Programming Style
Guide. 

@section messages_gettingdata Getting Data from CARMEN

Sensor data currently comes from one of two sources: the base module (such as
scout, pioneer, etc.) provides raw odometry data and may provide sonar data,
bumper data and infra-red (IR) data. The laser module may provide laser data.

@subsection messages_sub_sub Subscribing

All of the following messages can be subscribed to by using helper functions
in the appropriate \c xxx_interface library, e.g., \c base_interface.
The helper functions are all of the form:

@verbatim
void carmen_robot_subscribe_xxxx_message(carmen_robot_xxx_message *msg,
                                         carmen_handler_t handler, 
                                         carmen_subscribe_t subscribe_how);
@endverbatim

where \c carmen_handler_t and \c carmen_subscribe_t are defined as

@verbatim
typedef enum {CARMEN_UNSUBSCRIBE, CARMEN_SUBSCRIBE_LATEST, 
              CARMEN_SUBSCRIBE_ALL} carmen_subscribe_t;
typedef void (*carmen_handler_t)(void *);
@endverbatim

If the \c msg field of the subscribe function is \c NULL, then a
static message is automatically allocated and returned as the argument to
\c handler, otherwise the message pointer passed to the subscribe function
is always used. In all cases, the same memory is re-used for all handled
messages of the same message name, and passed as an argument to the handler
function. 

If the \c handler field of the subscribe function is \c NULL, no
handler is called, but the memory pointed to by \c msg is updated
regularly. If both \c handler and \c msg are both \c NULL, your
program will spend a fair chunk of time doing nothing useful for you. 

The \c subscribe_how field allows the user to either unsubscribe, or to
start a new subscription. Subscribing only to the latest message allows the
module to fall behind in processing messages without serious consequences. It
should be pointed out that subscribing to all messages
(\c CARMEN_SUBSCRIBE_ALL) does not guarantee all messages. Currently, the
upper limit for the queue size is 1000 messages. If an IPC process actually
subscribes to \emph{all} messages and falls seriously behind (or wedges),
central can run out of memory, or even worse, the TCP stack can
overflow. Consequently, the CARMEN subscription functions limit the maximum
message queue size to 1000. A resourceful programmer can increase this queue
(or even remove the queue size), but it is not clear this would ever be
necessary. 

@subsection messages_requesting Requesting Data Explicitly

Some of these messages can also be obtained using explicit queries. To date,
the only robot data that can be obtained using queries are from localize and
navigator. Specifically, \c carmen_localize_globalpos_message,
\c carmen_localize_particle_message,
\c carmen_navigator_status_message and
\c carmen_navigator_plan_message can all be obtained using specific query
interface functions, which return the appropriate messages directly.

These functions create new memory every time they return successfully;
consequently, they should be used with care.

@subsubsection messages_base Sensor Data from the Base

The \c timestamp field in all messages is defined to be the time when the
data was first created or acquired (e.g, by \c scout or \c simulator).

@subsubsection messages_odom Odometry

@verbatim
void carmen_base_subscribe_odometry_message(carmen_base_odometry_message *odometry,
                                            carmen_handler_t handler,
                                            carmen_subscribe_t subscribe_how);
@endverbatim

The \c x, y, theta fields are the raw odometry, from the time the robot
was turned on. The tv and rv fields are the translational and rotational
velocities of the robot. For robots that have differential drive (as opposed
to synchrodrive), these velocities are computed from the left and right wheel
velocities that base actual uses. 

@subsubsection messages_sonar Sonar

Sonar sensing is not properly supported by CARMEN right now, and so
subscribing to \c carmen_base_sonar_message messages may sometimes not
work properly. But, if you care, it looks like:

@verbatim
void carmen_base_subscribe_sonar_message(carmen_base_sonar_message *sonar,
                                         carmen_handler_t handler,
                                         carmen_subscribe_t subscribe_how);
@endverbatim

The sonar message reports a recent set of sonar range data from the
base. There should be as many range points and offset points as described by
\c num_sonars. The \c sonar_offsets describes the physical location
and orientation of each transducer from the centre of the robot. 

There is currently no way to query the firing rate or order of the sonar
transducers, and the sonar\_conf message is not yet supported. (Or even defined
by any module.)

@\subsubsection lmessages_laser Laser data

Laser data is defined as a set of ranges, of number given by the
\c num_readings field, contained in \c range. The number of ranges is
almost always 180, since we only support SICK lasers in \f$1^\circ\f$ increments
at the moment. Each range measurement is the distance to the nearest obstacle
along some heading. The first range is along the \f$-\pi/2\f$ direction (of
course, in the robot's local frame of reference, where \f$0^\circ\f$ is directly
ahead) and the last range is along the \f$+\pi/2-\frac{1}{180}\f$ heading. In
degrees, that is from \f$-90^\circ\f$ to \f$+89^\circ\f$. The increment is currently
\f$1^\circ\f$. The order is right-handed (counter-clockwise). Remember that this
is all with reference to a laser that is mounted facing the front of the
robot, with the laser right way up (the serial and power connectors are on
top). For rear laser messages, the measurements go from \f$+\pi/2\f$ through \f$\pi\f$
to \f$-\pi/2-\frac{1}{180}\f$. If you mount the laser upside down, the
measurements go from \f$+\pi/2\f$ through \f$0\f$ to \f$-\pi/2-\frac{1}{180}\f$. For
forward pointing lasers, you can pretty much assume the laser is mounted the
right way up.

The \c timestamp field in all messages is defined to be the time when the
data was first created or acquired (e.g, by \c laser or \c simulator),
not the timestamp of some intermediate process (such as the correction applied
by \c robot when applying odometry interpolation and correction).
Similarly, the \c hostfield is defined to be the hostname associated with
the origin of the data, not the hostname of some intermediary converting the
data from raw form to interpolated form. 

@verbatim
void carmen_laser_subscribe_frontlaser_message(carmen_laser_laser_message *laser,
                                               carmen_handler_t handler,
                                               carmen_subscribe_t subscribe_how);
void carmen_laser_subscribe_rearlaser_message(carmen_laser_laser_message *laser,
                                              carmen_handler_t handler,
                                              carmen_subscribe_t subscribe_how);
@endverbatim

This message is defined by \c laser and by \c simulator, and the same
message struct is used by both \c carmen_laser_frontlaser and
\c carmen_laser_rearlaser messages. As a consequence, there is no way to
tell from a message itself whether or not the message is a front laser message
or a rear laser message. This hopefully will be fixed in a future release.

@subsubsection messages_robot Robot messages

These messages are defined and emitted by \c robot.

<ul>

\li \c carmen_robot_laser_message

@verbatim
void carmen_robot_subscribe_frontlaser_message(carmen_robot_laser_message *laser,
                                               carmen_handler_t handler,
                                               carmen_subscribe_t subscribe_how);

void carmen_robot_subscribe_rearlaser_message(carmen_robot_laser_message *laser,               
                                              carmen_handler_t handler,
                                              carmen_subscribe_t subscribe_how);

@endverbatim

The \c carmen_robot_laser_message has raw odometry attached to it. The
\c robot module attempts to adjust for clock skews and interpolate the
true robot position of the data correctly based on time stamps. Consequently,
after a \c carmen_laser_laser_message is received, the corresponding
\c carmen_robot_laser_message will not be emitted until a
\c carmen_base_odometry_message with a later timestamp is received. The
odometry fields are \c x, \c y and \c theta. These fields are in
fact the interpolated position of \emph{this laser}, based on the laser offset
parameters for this laser. The interpolated odometry for the robot itself are
the \c odom_x, \c odom_y and \c odom_theta  fields. Consequently,
front and rear laser messages with the same timestamps should have different
values for their \c x, \c y and \c theta  fields, but identical
values for their \c odom_x, \c odom_y and \c odom_theta fields.

The \c robot module is also used to perform collision avoidance, stopping
the robot if the laser measurements indicate an obstacle inside safety
margins. The \c tooclose array labels each range measurement as to whether
or not it lies inside the robot safety margins. There are as many
\c tooclose elements as there are \c range elements (as given by the
\c num_readings field). If \c msg.tooclose[i] is 1, then the range
\c msg.range[i] is inside the safety margin. 

The same message struct is used by both the \c carmen_robot_frontlaser
and \c carmen_robot_rearlaser  messages. Again, there is no way to tell
from a message itself whether or not the message is a front laser message or a
rear laser message. This hopefully will be fixed in a future release.

</ul>

@subsection messages_map Map-based Navigation Messages

@subsubsection messages_localize Localize Messages

<ul>

\li \c carmen_localize_globalpos_message

@verbatim
void carmen_localize_subscribe_globalpos_message(carmen_localize_globalpos_message *globalpos,
                                                 carmen_handler_t handler,
                                                 carmen_subscribe_t subscribe_how);
@endverbatim

This message reports on the current robot pose estimate, given by localize.

The \c globalpos field is mean robot position (computed from the particle
filter), and is given in the global frame of reference. (See the CARMEN Style
Guide.) The \c odometrypos is the odometry of the robot at the time the
current estimate was computed. It is therefore possible to estimate the true
position of the robot for a short duration after the last
\c carmen_localize_globalpos_message by finding the relative displacement
(translational and rotational) of the robot between the current odometry, and
the odometry of the last \c carmen_localize_globalpos_message, and then
adding this displacement to the \c globalpos field. There is a helper
function in \c liblocalize_interface called
\c carmen_localize_correct_odometry that does exactly this. 

Notice that CARMEN localize no longer explicitly provides correction
parameters, but instead provides a functional way to correct odometry. 

The \c globalpos_std gives the variances of the position estimates,
\f$\sigma_x^2, \sigma_y^2, \sigma_\theta^2\f$. The \c globalpos_xy_cov field
gives the covariance \f$\sigma_{xy}\f$. 

The \c converged field indicates whether localize is currently in global
or tracking mode. If localize has converged (is in tracking mode) then the
position estimate has high confidence. When localize believes it is lost, it
switches back to global localization mode and the \c converged field
switches to 1. 

Additional messages about the state of localize are:

\li \c carmen_localize_particle_message -- This message gives the full
state of the pose particle filter (and people particle filters, if people
tracking is running.)

\li \c carmen_localize_sensor_message -- This message contains
information about how localize has used each laser reading, such as whether a
laser readings was integrated (or not), and which person filter the reading
was assigned (if any).

\li \c carmen_localize_people_message -- This message contains the
current state of the person tracker, if it is running. 
</ul>

@subsubsection messages_autonav Autonomous Navigation

<ul>

\li \c carmen_navigator_plan_message

@verbatim
void carmen_navigator_subscribe_status_message(carmen_navigator_status_message *status,
                                               carmen_handler_t handler,
                                               carmen_subscribe_t subscribe_how);

int carmen_navigator_query_status(carmen_navigator_status_message **status);

@endverbatim

The \c autonomous field is 1 if the robot is currently trying to
autonomously navigate to the goal, perhaps because a user clicked the
\c Autonomous button in the navigator\_panel display. When the robot
changes to non-autonomous mode, a
\c carmen_navigator_autonomous_stopped_message is emitted (see below), and
contains the reason for changing to non-autonomous mode.

The \c goal_set field is 1 if the navigator has received any goal at
all. If no goal has been set, then it is not possible for the navigator go
into autonomous mode. 

The \c goal field reports on what the navigator's current goal. The
navigator does not (and should not ever) support multiple goal destinations. 

The \c robot field is the navigator's estimate of the current robot
position in the global reference frame (see the CARMEN Style Guide). This is
based on the latest estimate from localize, combined with any subsequent
odometric updates the navigator has received. The \c robot position field
reported by the navigator should never lag behind (in time) localize's
estimate. 

\li \c carmen_navigator_plan_message

@verbatim
void carmen_navigator_subscribe_plan_message(carmen_navigator_plan_message *plan,
                                           carmen_handler_t handler,
                                           carmen_subscribe_t subscribe_how);

int carmen_navigator_query_plan(carmen_navigator_plan_message **plan);

@endverbatim

If the path length is 0, then there is no path from the current robot location
to the goal. The first point in the path should always be the robot's current
position as reported by the \c carmen_navigator_status_message, and the
last point in the path should always be the goal as reported by
\c carmen_navigator_status_message. 

\li \c carmen_navigator_autonomous_stopped_message

@verbatim
void carmen_navigator_subscribe_autonomous_stopped_message
                    (carmen_navigator_autonomous_stopped_message *autonomous_stopped,
                     carmen_handler_t handler,
                     carmen_subscribe_t subscribe_how);
@endverbatim

The \c reason field can take one of three values:
<ul>
\li \c CARMEN_NAVIGATOR_GOAL_REACHED_v -- This means that the robot has
reached the goal destination (that is, is within the
\c robot_approach_dist of the goal).
\li \c CARMEN_NAVIGATOR_USER_STOPPED_v -- This means that some other
process (such as the navigator\_panel) published a
\c carmen_navigator_stop_message. 
\li \c CARMEN_NAVIGATOR_UNKNOWN_v -- This means some (unknown) reason
caused autonomous navigation to stop. The navigator does not currently ever
emit this reason.
</ul>

</ul>

@section messages_command Commanding the robot

While it is (obviously) possible to send messages directly to the base module,
this is not an exposed interface. Sending velocities directly to the base
side-steps the last-mile collision avoidance module, and can also result in
all kinds of pathologies as modules fight for control of the robot.

@subsection messages_moving Moving the Robot

<ul>

\li \c carmen_robot_velocity_message

@verbatim
void carmen_robot_velocity_command(double tv, double rv);
@endverbatim

Publishing this message will tell the \c robot module to make the robot go
at the specified translation velocity \c tv specified rotational velocity
\c rv.

The robot may not be able to go at these speeds, because either they exceed
the maximum velocity, or because an obstacle is too close. There is no
diagnostic for the first condition yet. The second condition can be detected
by examining the \c tooclose field of the
\c carmen_robot_laser_message.

\li \c carmen_robot_vector_move_message

@verbatim
void carmen_robot_velocity_command(double distance, double theta);
@endverbatim

Publishing this message will take advantage of a PD loop in the robot module
to make the robot go to specific target point. This control loop contains no
planning, so if an obstacle intervenes between the robot and the target, the
robot will stop. 

The target point set by this message is given by the \c distance and
\c theta fields, which are in metres and radians respectively, and are
\emph{relative} to the robot's current pose. Consequently, a positive
\c distance with a \c theta of 0 would drive the robot forward
\c distance metres. Similarly, a \c distance of 0 and a \c theta 
of \f$\pi\f$ would cause the robot to rotate \f$180^\circ\f$, regardless of current
orientation. 

</ul>

@subsection messages_initloc Initializing Localize

@subsubsection  messages_locinimsg carmen\_localize\_initialize\_message

This message provides a way to initialize localization.

@verbatim
typedef struct {
  int distribution;
  carmen_point_t mean, std;
  double timestamp;
  char* host;
} carmen_localize_initialize_message;
@endverbatim

The \c distribution specifies the kind of distribution to use for
initialization. At the moment only one type of distribution is supported:
\c CARMEN_INITIALIZE_GAUSSIAN. (The \c localize_messages.h file also
lists a \c CARMEN_INITIALIZE_UNIFORM distribution type, but this is not
currently supported by localize itself.) 

The 3-dimensional point \c mean specifies the \f$x, y, \theta\f$ mean of the
gaussian, and \c std specified the \f$\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_\theta\f$
standard deviations of the gaussian. Reasonable values for the standard
deviations are \f$(0.2m, 0.2m, 4.0^\circ)\f$. 

It is also possible to initialize localize through the navigator by using the
\c carmen_navigator_set_robot or \c carmen_navigator_set_robot_map 
messages, but these messages are deprecated.

@subsubsection messages_goal Setting A Goal

This message provides a way to set the goal or destination for navigation. It
is not possible (nor should it ever be possible) to set multiple goals inside
the navigator.

@verbatim
typedef struct {
  double x, y;
  double timestamp;
  char* host;
} carmen_navigator_set_goal_message;

int carmen_navigator_set_goal(double x, double y);

typedef struct {
  char *placename;
  double timestamp;
  char* host;
} carmen_navigator_placename_message;

int carmen_navigator_set_goal_place(char *name);

@endverbatim

The \f$(x, y)\f$ fields should be self-explanatory as the goal position, in the
global reference frame (see the CARMEN Style Guide), as always in metres.

If the map contains place names, then it is also possible to set the goal
position using a \c carmen_navigator_placename_message, and the
\c carmen_navigator_set_goal_place helper function. This has no effect if
the map does not contain a place name that matches. 

@subsection messages_automon Autonomous Motion

These messages toggle the navigator in and out of autonomous motion. 

@verbatim
typedef struct {
  double timestamp;
  char* host;
} carmen_navigator_go_message;

typedef struct {
  double timestamp;
  char* host;
} carmen_navigator_stop_message;

int carmen_navigator_stop(void);

int carmen_navigator_go(void);

@endverbatim

If the robot is already at the current goal position, then the
\c carmen_navigator_go_command will cause the navigator to change
momentarily into autonomous mode, and then switch back again, emitting a
\c carmen_navigator_autonomous_stopped_message with
\c CARMEN_NAVIGATOR_GOAL_REACHED_v as the reason.

When the navigator receives a \c carmen_navigator_stop_message, then a
\c carmen_navigator_autonomous_stopped_message is emitted with
\c CARMEN_NAVIGATOR_USER_STOPPED_v as the reason.


@section gettingparams Getting Parameters

Parameters can be acquired from the parameter server using functions in
\c libparam_interface, eg: 

@verbatim
int carmen_param_get_int(char *variable, int *return_value);
int carmen_param_get_double(char *variable, double *return_value);
int carmen_param_get_onoff(char *variable, int *return_value);
int carmen_param_get_string(char *variable, char **return_value);
@endverbatim

The conversion of parameters to ints, doubles, etc. is done on demanded by the
interface library. If you do not wish the library to convert the parameter to
the appropriate type, simply request the parameter as a string.

If there is no definition for the parameter requested, then the library will
output a warning to the terminal, unless this warning has been turned off
using \c carmen_param_allow_unfound_variables(1);. 

Also, as a convience, variables can be requested either by specifying the
fully qualified \c module_param-name name, or by first specifying a module
using \c carmen_param_set_module(char *), and the specifying just the
\c param-name form. 

@subsection messages_subchange Subscribing to Changes

Some processes may wish to subscribe to changes to parameters during their
execution, for example changing the robot speed or acceleration profile, or
changing the \c robotgraph display parameters. Of course, some processes
should not suscribe to some parameter changes: changing the number of
particles localize uses during execution would result in disaster.

Parameter changes can be subscribed using the functions below:
@verbatim
void carmen_param_subscribe_int(char *module, char *variable, int *variable_address, 
                                carmen_param_change_handler_t handler);
void carmen_param_subscribe_double(char *module, char *variable, double *variable_address, 
                                   carmen_param_change_handler_t handler);
void carmen_param_subscribe_onoff(char *module, char *variable, int *variable_address, 
                                  carmen_param_change_handler_t handler);
void carmen_param_subscribe_string(char *module, char *variable, char **variable_address, 
                                   carmen_param_change_handler_t handler);
@endverbatim

These functions take a module and variable name as parameters. The
subscription mechanism can either silently change variable values as
parameters change, or can invoke a callback when a parameter is changed. If
the \c variable_address parameter is non-NULL, then the new parameter
value is stored at this address (in the case of strings, this is a pointer to
some newly-malloc'd memory containing the new string definition. If the
variable address is non-NULL when the parameter changes, the old memory is
freed.) If the \c handler parameter is non-NULL, then function pointed to
by \c handler is invoked whenever the parameter changes. If both are
non-NULL, then the variable changes and then the callback invoked. If both are
NULL, then the subscription mechanism does not do much. 

@subsection messages_fac The Parameter Factory

Parameters can be loaded in a single step using the parameter factory methods,
much like the gtk menu item factory methods. The set of parameters to be
loaded should be described in an array of \c carmen_param_t, and passed to
@verbatim
void carmen_param_install_params(int argc, char *argv[], carmen_param_p param_list, 
                                 int num_items);
@endverbatim

Each parameter in the array of type \c carmen_param_t has the form:
@verbatim
typedef struct {
  char *module;
  char *variable;
  carmen_param_type_t type;
  void *user_variable;
  int subscribe;
  carmen_param_change_handler_t handler;
} carmen_param_t;
@endverbatim
where \c module is the module name, \c variable is the variable name,
\c type is one of \c CARMEN_PARAM_INT, \c CARMEN_PARAM_DOUBLE,
\c CARMEN_PARAM_ONOFF or \c CARMEN_PARAM_STRING. The parameter is
loaded into \c user_variable, whose original type should match that
specified in the \c type field.

If \c subscribe is set to 1, then the process will subscribe to changes to
the parameter, and set up a callback on the function specified in
\c handler (if not NULL). The callback parameter is ignored if
\c subscribe is set to 0, and the parameter is only loaded once. There is
no way to use the parameter factory methods, subscribe to a variable and not
have the variable's value updated automatically. 

If \c carmen_param_allow_unfound_variables() is set to 0 (by default),
then \c carmen_param_install_params will exit with an error on the first
parameter absent from the parameter server, reporting what the problematic
parameter is.

If a process loads its parameter set using the parameter factory methods, then
running the process with the \c -h or \c -help command line option
will print out a list of parameters used by that process, their expected types
and whether or not the process subscribes to changes.
