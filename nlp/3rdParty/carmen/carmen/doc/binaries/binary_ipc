@section ipc_main central

Central is the central communication server inside CARMEN. Therefore,
the first thing you need to do is to start central. Without this
server, no CARMEN module will work! In order to tell your module which
server it should connect to, you have to specify the CENTRALHOST
environment variable <b>for each shell</b> you are starting a module
in using

<h3> setenv CENTRALHOST localhost </h3>  
or
<h3> export CENTRALHOST=localhost </h3>  
depending on the shell you are using.



<h3>Usage: ./central</h3>
