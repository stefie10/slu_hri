@section localize_main Localize

The localize module implements the classical Monte-Carlo localization
using a particle filter. It can perform global localization and pose
tracking.  Note that localize needs a map, otherwise, it will not
work. The performance of localize mainly depends on the number of
particles. The bigger that number, the slower runs the localization
but is typically more robust.

Localize uses a set of parameters that (strongly) influence the
robustness and performance of localize. This is mainly the observation
likelihood model and the noise in the motion model. You will find
those parameters as expert parameters in the ini file. However, the
standard configuration should work fine with robots equipped with SICK
laser range finders.

<h3>Usage: ./localize</h3>

@section localize_initialize_main localize_initialize

A tool to initilaize the localization. Global localization as well as
a Gaussians initialization using a placename can be used.

<h3>Usage: ./localize global</h3>

for global localization or

<h3>Usage: ./localize \<placename\></h3>

for initilaizing the robot a certain place given by placename.
