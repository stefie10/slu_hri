<h2>The Laser Driver</h2>


@section laser_main Laser

The laser module provides the hardware driver for SICK LMS and PLS
laser range finders. Currently, there is no support for other range
finder devices, however, a Hokuyo urg driver will be provided soon.

The module sends out the CARMEN_LASER_LASER_MESSAGEs which can be
directly received by other modules. In most cases, however, one uses
the CARMEN_ROBOT_LASER_MESSAGEs because they combined odometry and
laser data (and are send by robot).
