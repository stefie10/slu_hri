<h2>GPS Device Driver</h2>

@section gps_main Gps-nmea

The gps-nmea module provides the hardware driver for typical consumer
GPS devices (like, for example, Garmin devices). The device is supposed
to provide the NMEA message as text format.

Currently two NMEA messages are supported. The first one is the NMEA-GGA
message which provides the position estimates and the NMEA-RMC message
which provides the ground speed estimate.

<h3>Usage: ./gps-nmea</h3>
