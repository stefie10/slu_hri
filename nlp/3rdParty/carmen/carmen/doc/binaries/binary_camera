<h2>Camera</h2>

All binaries in this module do one basic thing: publish images. 

The camera_quickcam loads images from /dev/video0 using the pwcx driver, and
publishes them.

The camera_fakecam publishes a static (fake) image of a gopher holding a
bazooka (a.k.a. Canadian army). Useful for debugging.

camera_view subscribes to the image messages and renders them in a window.
