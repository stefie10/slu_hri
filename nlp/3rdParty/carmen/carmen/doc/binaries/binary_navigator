<h2>Navigator</h2>


@section navigator_main The Navigator

The navigator uses a shortest-path motion planner to find a path from the
current robot pose to a goal pose. If no path exists, the navigator finds a
path to the nearest (in Euclidean distance) point that the robot can
reach. The path is assumed to be a set of joined line-segments defined by a
set of way-points. Once a path has been computed, if the navigator is put into
autonomous mode (by sending a navigator_go() message), then the navigator will
use a P-D controller to drive from one waypoint to the next. 

The navigator subscribes to global position messages from localize, odometry
messages from the base and laser messages. The laser messages are used to make
local changes to the map, allowing the navigator to replan around unmapped
obstacles. The navigator does not require localize to be running, but
navigation without accurate position estimates is likely to fail. 

<h3>Usage: ./navigator</h3>


@section navigator_gui The Navigator GUI

The navigatorgui provides a view of the internal state of the navigator, as
well as a way to set goals, start the robot moving, and initialize the robot
position (assuming localize is running).

<h3>Usage: ./navigatorgui</h3>
