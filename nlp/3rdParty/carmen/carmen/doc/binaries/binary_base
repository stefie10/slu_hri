<h2>Base - Hardware Drivers for Different Robots</h2>

The base modules provide the hardware access to the individual robots. Currently,
CARMEN supports the following devices.

Driver for ActivMedia Pioneer 1 and 2 robots. The Pioneer 3 series
seem to have the same internals than Pioneer 2DX8+ robots, so they are
