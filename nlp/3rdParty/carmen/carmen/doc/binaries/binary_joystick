@section wingman_main Wingman_control

Controller for the cool Logitech Wireless Wingman joystick. It makes
life much easier when navigating a robot manually, for example, to log
data.

Wingman_control has two modes:

standard mode: uses the small joysticks to translational speed and
rotational speed of the robot.

throttle control mode: uses the throttle control to set the
translational velocity. That mode is great for long datasets and if you
which to have more or less constant translational speed. The
rotational velocity is controlled by one of the small joysticks. 

To change between normal mode and throttle control mode simply press
one of the big four buttons.
