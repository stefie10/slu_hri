<h2>Vasco - The Mapper</h2>

@section vasco_main Vasco

Vasco is the mapper of CARMEN which is based on scan-matching. The
binary vasco actually provides a user interface that allows to load
and correct log files recorded with a mobile robot.

<h3>Usage: ./vasco</h3>

@section vasco_tiny Vasco-tiny

Vasco-tiny is a small command line tool to correct a logfile using
scan-matching. It is easy to use but provides less functionality
compared to Vasco itself.

<h3>Usage: ./vasco-tiny \<carmen log file\> \> corrected.clf  </h3>


@section vasco_core The Vascocore Library

The core functionality of vasco is encapsualted into a library called
vascocore (libvascocore.a). All scan-matching functions can therefore
been used by external programs. Please see the source code
documentation of @href vascocore.h or futher details.
