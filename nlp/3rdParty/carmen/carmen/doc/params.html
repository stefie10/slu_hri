<h2>Parameters and the carmen.ini File</h2>


@section params_main The Paramdaemaon 


CARMEN programs use the param_daemon, a repository or registry of
values for parameters to be used during the operation of a robot. The
intention of the parameter server is to ensure that all modules are
using the same parameters definitions, such as maximum allowable
velocity, robot size, etc. Many robot code suites require that each
separate process reads the parameter values directly from a file. We
have chosen the parameter server approach because different processes
frequently reside on different computer, which would entail having
copies of the same file on each such computer. This often leads to
having copies of different files on each computer, with undesirable
results. Secondly, the parameter server facilitates for dynamic
updating of parameter values; for instance, the maximum speed of the
robot can be changed during the operation of the robot, without
restarting any processes. This necessitates some additional overhead
on the part of each process, to ensure that each process is subscribed
to changes in each variable. This document will describe how best to
do this.

The parameter server is intended to serve parameters that can vary
across robots, or across execution runs. Parameters that cannot change
should not be served by the parameter server. For example, the maximum
preferred translational velocity for a particular deployment is served
as robot_max_t_vel. However, each robot (such as the scout) has
a practical maximum wheel velocity; this value should be hard-coded in
the base module for that robot, instead of being served. Similarly,
for rflex robots, the odometry conversion factor from wheel tics to
metres is hard-coded, as this is a hardware dependent value and cannot
change.

Finally, the parameter server can also be used as a map server. This
ensures that all processes are using the same map, with the same
resolution, etc.  The does entail a performance penalty in terms of
bandwidth loss at the start up of each process, but we believe that
resultant the ease of use, in terms of needing only one copy of the
map and ensuring consistency, is an acceptable bargain.


@section The Structure of carmen.ini File


The parameter server reads parameter definitions from the ini file,
or, if no ini file name is provided on the command line, then attempts
to load parameters from ./carmen.ini, ../carmen.ini, and finally
../src/carmen.ini. If no parameter file can be found, then the process
exits with an error.

To make life easier, multiple robot definitions can be contained in a
single ini file. Therefore, the parameter server requires a robot name
to select a set of parameters, using the required argument -r <robot
name>. At start up, the parameter server loads all the parameter
definitions listed under the generic [*] parameter set, and also all
the parameters listed under the matching robot name. There are also
expert parameters in the section [expert]. These values, however, do
not teed to be changed in general. See them as constants.

The parameter server can also serve maps, subsuming the functionality
of the map server.  Finally, the parameter server also performs sanity
checks, to make sure that all running CARMEN processes are the same
version, to ensure consistency among message formats, etc. All
programs are expected to call carmen_param_check_version() immediately
after initializing the IPC connection.

The ini file format is ASCII, intended to be human readable and
editable using emacs. Given the somewhat hierarchical nature of the
file, a markup language such as XML may have been preferable, but this
seems like overkill for a fairly simple IO task.

The file consists of robot definition sections, delimited at the start by
@verbatim
[<section name>]
@endverbatim

and delimited at the end by the start of another section, or by the
end-of-file. The section name should either be * (for all robots),
expert (for expert parameters) or be the name of a robot to be
specified on the command line when starting the parameter server.

Each section consists of parameter definitions, given by:
@verbatim
<module name>_<parameter name> <value>
@endverbatim

The module name can contain any characters except white space and the
underscore (`_') character. The parameter name can contain any
characters except whitespace. The parameter value can contain any characters
at all, but the value ends with the end of line. There is no mechanism for
writing parameter values across multiple lines. Trailing whitespace is trimmed
from parameter values. 

Comment lines must have `#' at the first character of each line. 

Parameter values can be no longer than 2048 characters, and the concatenation
of module names and parameter names can also be no longer than 255
characters. There is a limit of 128 unique module names.

If a variable is specified twice, then only the last value is retained.
